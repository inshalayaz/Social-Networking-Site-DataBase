<h1>INTRODUCTION OF THE PROJECT</h1>
A social networking site is an online platform that allows users to create a
public profile and interact with other users. Social networking sites usually
allow a new user to provide a list of people with whom they share a
connection, and then allow the people on the list to confirm or deny the
connection. After connections are established, the new user can search the
networks of connections to make more connections.
A social networking site is also known as a social networking website or
social website.
